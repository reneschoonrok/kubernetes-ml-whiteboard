# Kubernetes deployments through whiteboard and machinelearning OCR
An experiment trying to make kubernetes deployments easier with machine learning
This uses: Python 2.7, Opencv2 and TesseractOCR. The training set for characters is provided also as a large file.

You can use stickers, t-shirts and text-notes ;)
It can deploy to and delete from kubernetes (turn up the resolution to 720p for the camera for delete. see in code)
